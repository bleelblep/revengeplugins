 * bar-width row (see ui/layout.ts for why it must stay inside its parent's bounds).
 *
 * Deliberately not animated -- it just appears and disappears. Animating it turned out to be
 * a persistent source of bugs (a native-driven transform kept getting reset to a stale value
 * by the bar's frequent re-renders, leaving the pill stuck on the previously-selected row),
 * and the shape morph in MorphIcon already carries the transition. Plain conditional render:
 * nothing to get out of sync.
